# MTicTacToe

Almost like a regular "Tic Tac Toe" game, but here you can choose the size of the board and the amount of players! 
The functions are dynamic also, why the program is efficient on tunning time?

1. Checks the winner only if there enough turns to determine a winner
2. The program checks a winner only on the position that the player played
