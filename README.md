Mega Tic Tac Toe

Almost like a regular "Tic Tac Toe" game, but here you can choose the size of the board and the amount of players! 
The functions are dynamic also, why the program is efficient on tunning time?

1. Checks the winner only if there enough turns to determine a winner
2. The program checks a winner only on the position that the player played

<h3>Notes: </h3>
The player to start will be selected randomly. <br>
On the start of the game you can your letter. <br>
There are global variables at the start of the code where you can decide the range of board sizes. <br>
The position are printed with the number of each position.
